# Intro
Hi, I’m Circle (or Moth, if you prefer). I’m an artistic, neurodivergent (autistic + ADHD) dude who loves creating all kinds of dumb stuff—drawing, painting, making questionable music, crafting, and occasionally animating. My art is fueled by either pure love or complete hatred, because that’s just how I roll.

Personality-wise, I’m a chill, laid-back ISTP 4w5. I’m into object shows (HFJ0NE is a fav), Roblox, Minecraft, the Backrooms, and way too much else to list. Socially, I’m hella awkward—my humor is either trash or nonexistent, and I often communicate in gestures rather than words. But hey, I try. :P

 things you gotta know when you interact with me:
1. As I mentioned before, I’m really awkward in chats. I'm the most confident talking with those I’m close with. Sometimes I can get really quiet when hanging out I hope you don’t mind, because I also don’t mind if you do the same
2. 	I might forget your name if I don’t know you well because I’m just a professional name-forgetter
3. 	On PonyTown, if you wanna interact or perhaps c + h with me, feel free to do so! Cuddling with people is fun :D
4. 	If you’re gonna make a joke, I’d suggest not making it anything suggestive because I’m a minor. Even aside from that, it’s just common sense to NOT be spitting out weird stuff at people you don’t know. I don’t think anybody would want that.
5. I  might not completely respond to your texts most of the time. Either I’m off-tab or busy with something. If that’s the case, I’d recommend whispering 
6. My humor is weird and sometimes just bad. If I make a joke and it doesn’t land, just pretend it did /j
7.  I’m not good at small talk. If I respond dryly or don’t say much, it’s not because I don’t like you, I just don’t always know what to say
8. On the flip side, if I don’t care about something, my reaction might be underwhelming. Please don't take it personally

9. If I seem to ignore a message, I probably didn’t see it or didn’t know how to respond. Feel free to poke me about it :<
10.  Don’t force or push me to do things for you. I have my own boundaries, and I would appreciate it if you don’t break them, otherwise, I’ll just block you.
11. I don’t know how to talk to two people at once, so just wait till I finish my convo with that person.

Random facts:
1. My interests can really vary and sometimes switch quickly, so for example, one week you’d find me liking Friday Night Funkin' and then the week after I would like Cookie Run 
2. I love music, like a lot If you’re wondering, I mostly like alternative music and punk. Yes, there’s a mix of other genres here and there, but this is what I mostly like
   
3.I fucking despise Two Times with every fiber of my being. That pretentious, condescending smile of theirs makes my skin crawl. I don't even know what it is about them, but every single thing about them rubs me the wrong way. I wish they'd just vanish into thin air, or better yet, get hit by a car or something. I'd take great pleasure in watching them suffer in agony #JusticeForAzure
4. I’m a certified Asian living in Asia, so English isn’t my first language
