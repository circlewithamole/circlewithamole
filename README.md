# Intro
Hi, I’m Circle, or Moth as others like to call me. As displayed on my profile, I am a very awesome person who’s got his own things going for him

I’m an artistic individual who loves making all kinds of DUMB things whether it’s drawing, painting, making (bad) music, or crafting. I also animate, but that happens rarely. My art can be inspired by things I love or complete hatered, because that’s just how I roll

Personality-wise, I’m just a chill guy. I can be laid-back and introverted, and if I had to be more specific, I’m an ISTP 4w5

I’m into a lot of things, including object shows (especially HFJONE), Roblox games (too many to name), Minecraft, and the Backrooms. There’s more, but I’m not listing everything here

I’m neurodivergent (autistic and ADHD), which already makes me coolistic and my four-wing on the Enneagram does that job too. Also, I’m not great at talking to people, like my social skills are okay, but I’m hella awkward. Most of the time, I just make gestures instead of talking. My sense of humor is trash, or maybe it just doesn’t exist. But hey, I try :P

 things you gotta know when you interact with me:
1. As I mentioned before, I’m really awkward in chats. I'm the most confident talking with those I’m close with. Sometimes I can get really quiet when hanging out I hope you don’t mind, because I also don’t mind if you do the same
2. 	I might forget your name if I don’t know you well because I’m just a professional name-forgetter
3. 	If you wanna interact or perhaps c + h with me, feel free to do so! Cuddling with people is fun :D
4. 	If you’re gonna make a game, I’d suggest not making it anything suggestive because I’m a minor. Even aside from that, it’s just common sense to NOT be spitting out weird stuff at people you don’t know. I don’t think anybody would want that.
5. 	I really don’t mind ships (except the illegal ones—you know who I’m talking about) so if you see me cosplaying as a character and wanna ship it with yours, go for it. Just make sure to ask first
6. I  might not completely respond to your texts most of the time. Either I’m off-tab or busy with something. If that’s the case, I’d recommend whispering 
7. My humor is weird and sometimes just bad. If I make a joke and it doesn’t land, just pretend it did /j
8.  I’m not good at small talk. If I respond dryly or don’t say much, it’s not because I don’t like you, I just don’t always know what to say
9. On the flip side, if I don’t care about something, my reaction might be underwhelming. Please don't take it personally

10. If I seem to ignore a message, I probably didn’t see it or didn’t know how to respond. Feel free to poke me about it :<
11.  Don’t force or push me to do things for you. I have my own boundaries, and I would appreciate it if you don’t break them, otherwise, I’ll just block you.
12. I don’t know how to talk to two people at once, so just wait till I finish my convo with that person.

Random Info:
1. My interests can really vary and sometimes switch quickly, so for example, one week you’d find me liking Friday Night Funkin' and then the week after I would like Cookie Run 
2. I love music, like a lot If you’re wondering, I mostly like alternative music and punk. Yes, there’s a mix of other genres here and there, but this is what I mostly like
   
3.I fucking despise Two Times with every fiber of my being. That pretentious, condescending smile of theirs makes my skin crawl. I don't even know what it is about them, but every single thing about them rubs me the wrong way. I wish they'd just vanish into thin air, or better yet, get hit by a car or something. I'd take great pleasure in watching them suffer in agony #JusticeForAzure
