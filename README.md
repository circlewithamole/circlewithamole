# Intro
Hi, I’m Circle (or Moth, if you prefer). I’m an artistic, neurodivergent (autistic + ADHD) dude who loves creating all kinds of dumb stuff—drawing, painting, making questionable music, crafting, and occasionally animating. My art is fueled by either pure love or complete hatred, because that’s just how I roll.

Personality-wise, I’m a chill, laid-back ISTP 4w5. I’m into object shows (HFJ0NE is a fav), Roblox, Minecraft, the Backrooms, and way too much else to list. Socially, I’m hella awkward—my humor is either trash or nonexistent, and I often communicate in gestures rather than words. But hey, I try :P

 things you gotta know when you interact with me:

1. I’m awkward in chats. I’m most confident talking to people I’m close with, and I can get really quiet sometimes. If I go silent, don’t worry—I don’t mind if you do the same.

2. I’m a professional name-forgetter. If I don’t know you well, I might forget your name. Sorry in advance!

4. On PonyTown, feel free to interact or c + h with me. Cuddling with people is fun, so don’t be shy! /D

5. Keep jokes appropriate. I’m a minor, so please avoid anything suggestive. Honestly, it’s just common sense not to be weird with people you don’t know.

6. I might not respond to texts right away. If I’m off-tab or busy, whispering me is the best way to get my attention.

7. My humor is weird (and sometimes bad). If I make a joke that doesn’t land, just pretend it did. /j

8. I’m not great at small talk. If I respond dryly or don’t say much, it’s not because I don’t like you—I just don’t always know what to say.

9.If I don’t care about something, my reaction might be underwhelming. Please don’t take it personally!

10. If I seem to ignore a message, I probably missed it or didn’t know how to respond. Feel free to poke me about it! :<

11. Don’t push me to do things. I have my own boundaries, and I’ll block you if you cross them.
    
12. I can’t multitask conversations. If I’m talking to someone else, just wait until I’m done.

Random facts:
1. My interests can really vary and sometimes switch quickly, so for example, one week you’d find me liking Friday Night Funkin' and then the week after I would like Cookie Run 
2. I love music, like a lot If you’re wondering, I mostly like alternative music and punk. Yes, there’s a mix of other genres here and there, but this is what I mostly like
   
3.I fucking despise Two Times with every fiber of my being. That pretentious, condescending smile of theirs makes my skin crawl. I don't even know what it is about them, but every single thing about them rubs me the wrong way. I wish they'd just vanish into thin air, or better yet, get hit by a car or something. I'd take great pleasure in watching them suffer in agony #JusticeForAzure

4. I’m a certified Asian born and living in Asia, so English isn’t my first language
